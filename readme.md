# Icarus Innovations, Improved

[![Nightly Build](https://github.com/HDest-Community/icarus-innovations-improved/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HDest-Community/icarus-innovations-improved/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

_Requires [BulletLib - Recasted](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDBulletLib-Recasted) and [AceCoreLib](https://github.com/HDest-Community/AceCoreLib), by the HDest Community._

This mod aims to maintain and improve Icarus's Innovations, by updating them to the latest HDest main, as well as tweaking/fixing any bugs that come along the way.  All weapons can be found naturally, as well as dropping from [Weapon Crates](https://github.com/HDest-Community/weapon-crate) and being sold by the [Merchant](https://github.com/HDest-Community/merchant).

### Finger of God
---

### Lore
After years of research into the Gretchenfrage phenomenon and losing countless battles to the Tyrant command creatures known only as "Archviles" We at Icarus Innovations have finally made a breakthrough.
Unable to completely nullify the effects of Gretchenfrage, we have devised a weapon capable of annihilating combatants with mass amounts of Gretchenfrage contained within themselves.
Using a newly developed energy wavelength that is directly inverse to Gretchenfrage, simply called "Anti-Frag", we can now send special teams to combat these Archviles directly, eliminate them and begin tearing down the Tyrant's command structure.
The weapon is still early in the development phase and is still quite heavy and uses a mass amount of power, usually consuming about half an entire power cell in a single burst after a short charge time but it has been yielding significant results.

Now comes with an efficiency upgrade which increases the total shots from 2 per battery to 4.
### Notes
---
- The Finger of God is a battery powered, energy cannon that can be found naturally in the world.
- The loadout code is `fog`.
